<p>My notes on the final section on Ruby from <em>Seven Languages in Seven Days</em> by Bruce Tate.</p>
<p>Ruby certainly seems to be a tight, fun language.  Although the lack of an IDE is a negative for me, especially since I don&#8217;t have encyclopedic knowledge of the libraries.  But it would be worth it to learn the basics to have a nice scripting language.</p>
<p>I was curious as to how a professional Ruby project might look.  How namespaces are handled, how the directory structure goes, etc.</p>
<p>I was surprised we weren&#8217;t spending more time with Ruby.  I guess I didn&#8217;t realize that we were getting four days off every week.</p>
