<p>I wanted to explore Ruby a little more so I needed to give myself a project.  I figured I would try to create a script to copy a playlist to my MP3 player, since both Rhythmbox and Banshee had issues with this.</p>
<p>The first thing is that I would need to get the ID3 tag information from the mp3 files so I could copy them to the right filename on the mp3 player.  (Both Rhythmbox and Banshee use <em>Artist</em> - <em>Album</em> - <em>Track</em> - <em>Title</em>.mp3 so I could that to check for duplicates.)  So I needed to be able to read mp3 tags.</p>
<p>I started at the ID3 format web site, <a href="http://www.id3.org/">http://www.id3.org/</a>.  They had a helpful section on implementations (<a href="http://www.id3.org/Implementations">http://www.id3.org/Implementations</a>) so I started there.</p>
<p>The first suggestion, id3lib-ruby was no longer under development.  The site did suggest taglib-ruby but I decided to move to the next one.</p>
<p>The next one was ruby-mp3info.  I rejected that one on the basis that the installation used Ruby&#8217;s <tt>gem</tt> utility.  (That later turned out to be a mistake.)</p>
<p>The final one was id3.rb and I did download the gem.  But the documentation was a little thin and it felt too much like a side project for a university student.</p>
<p>I decided to fire up synaptic and see if there was a package.  Lo and behold, there was one for ruby-taglib.  I installed it and tried the following simple script:</p>
<table border="0" bgcolor="#e8e8e8" width="100%" cellpadding="10"><tr><td><!-- Generator: GNU source-highlight 3.1.5 by Lorenzo Bettini http://www.lorenzobettini.it http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite --><pre><tt><b><font color="#000080">require</font></b> <font color="#FF0000">'taglib'</font><br />
<br />
ARGV<font color="#990000">.</font>each <b><font color="#0000FF">do</font></b> <font color="#990000">|</font>f<font color="#990000">|</font><br />
  TagLib<font color="#990000">::</font>FileRef<font color="#990000">.</font>open<font color="#990000">(</font>f<font color="#990000">)</font> <b><font color="#0000FF">do</font></b> <font color="#990000">|</font>fileref<font color="#990000">|</font><br />
    tag <font color="#990000">=</font> fileref<font color="#990000">.</font>tag<br />
    puts <font color="#FF0000">"#{f}: #{tag.title} by #{tag.artist}; track #{tag.track} on #{tag.album}"</font><br />
  <b><font color="#0000FF">end</font></b><br />
<b><font color="#0000FF">end</font></b></tt></pre></td></tr></table><p>Unfortunately the result was: <tt>NameError: uninitialized constant TagLib::FileRef</tt>.  I puzzled over this for a while and examined the documentation and probed the Ruby object to no avail.  Eventually I decided to try installing via the <tt>gem</tt> method.  No luck that way, same result.</p>
<p>Finally it occurred to me that the two installations might be conflicting.  I uninstalled both and re-installed via <tt>gem install taglib-ruby</tt>.  Now my script worked.</p>
