<p>I've had this one as a draft post for a while and I just ran into the it again, so it's time to to publish it. </p>
<p>I had a Linux server setup that I was getting a new developer to connect to.  Whatever we tried, we could not get him logged in via ssh using keys.  I verified the home directory permissions (at most 755), the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory permissions (700), the permissions of the files in the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory (600).  Other users could connect to the server using keys.  The developer could use the same client to connect to other ssh servers using keys. </p>
<p>Finally it occurred to me to check the SELinux context on the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory; it was missing the ssh_home_t context.  The repair is simple: <tt>restorecon -r -vv .ssh</tt></p>
<p>If you don't trust <tt>restorecon</tt> or you are just looking for an alternate fix, you can delete the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory and have the user connect to another ssh server from the target machine.  This will build the <tt>.ssh</tt> directory on the target server when the <tt>known_hosts</tt> file is created. </p>
