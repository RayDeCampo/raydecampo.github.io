<p>Just to get my feet wet, I published a Node.js module called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xirr">xirr</a>. </p>
 <p>When I was writing the unit tests for the module I had a particular case where the Newton's method implementation was not converging and the library I was using returned false.  My son, who has done a bit of coding was shoulder surfing and was asking me what we needed to do to make the the value be true.  When I explained that we actually wanted the library to return a number instead his head practically exploded.  So I went into the difference between a statically typed and dynamically typed language and he asked "Why don't you just change it to statically typed?" </p>
<p>So, how about EmcsScript committee?  Up for making ES7 a statically typed language? </p>
