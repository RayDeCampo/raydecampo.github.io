    <p>I finally took the plunge to migrate my old Blogger blog to the more convenient GitHub Pages.  Like everybody else I found when googling this topic discovered, it wasn't as easy as it seemed at first.</p>
<p>Using the jekyll-importer on the exported data from Blogger was straightforward and fast.</p>
<p>Trying to follow the various documentation on the GitHub site to get started wasn't very helpful to me.  What ended up being helpful was a tutorial at <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/</a> and the repository that went with it, <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now</a> both from Barry Clark.  I didn't end up following the tutorial exactly, but I used the working repository as a reference.</p>
<p>So I did follow the advice from GitHub and use Bundler to manage jekyll and Ruby and the dependencies.  To create the structure I used the command:</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">bundle <span class="token builtin class-name">exec</span> jekyll _3.3.0_ new raydecampo.github.io</code></pre>
<p>Then the site can be previewed locally with:</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">bundle <span class="token builtin class-name">exec</span> jekyll serve --watch</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to use a different theme, Dinky, from GitHub but ran into issues when switching.  It seems not all the required layouts are present in the theme or something.  So I had to create a <code>_layouts/post.html</code> file as detailed at <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/416#issuecomment-299772018">https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/416#issuecomment-299772018</a>.</p>
<p>Then I wanted to support tags, so I stole some code from GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/codinfox">codinfox</a> which was posted at <a href="https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/">https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/</a>.</p>
<p>I also ended up customizing the theme quite a bit and playing around with excerpts.  Then I wanted to try writing a post in Markdown, and that is how this post was born.</p>
<p>Finally I added some redirects for the old blogger URLs.  Fortunately the jekyll importer left the old URL in the front matter of the post, so it was easy to create a <code>redirect_from</code> directive in the front matter using JEdit's regex search and replace.  The RSS feed was a different matter, apparently there's no support for an arbitrary redirect on GitHub Pages, so I needed to add the following to my <code>_config.xml</code> to generate the feed in the same location as Blogger did:</p>
<pre><code>feed:
  path: /feeds/posts/default
</code></pre>
<p>Once this is up and running I will figure out how to use a custom domain.  UPDATE: Using a custom domain turned out to be pretty easy, just a change in the GitHub project Settings and update my DNS and all set.</p>
