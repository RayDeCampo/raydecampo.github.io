<p>New box, new OS, time for another edition of trying to connect to Microsoft's VPN software.  This time it is Fedora's turn.</p>
<p>This first part is adapted from my previous editions for Ubuntu and ultimately are sourced from an Ubuntu forums post by user sweisler at <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8261958&amp;postcount=6">http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=8261958&amp;postcount=6</a>.  Thanks sweisler, wherever you are.</p>
<p>First, there was no need to install any additional packages, apparently everything needed is included by default.</p>
<ul><li>Open VPN configuration screen: <ul><li>Click on the network icon in the upper right of the desktop </li><li>Expand the <em>VPN</em> menu </li><li>Select <em>VPN Settings</em></li><li>Select <em>Configure VPN&#8230;</em></li></ul></li><li>Add a new PPTP connection </li><li>In the Identity section, set the following: <ul><li><em>Connection name</em> (whatever you want) </li><li><em>Gateway</em> (this is the VPN server) </li><li><em>User name</em> (for domain-based user accounts, use domain\username or username) </li><li>Do <strong>not</strong> set <em>Password</em>; <strong>do</strong> change the pulldown (hidden in the help icon) to <em>Always Ask</em></li><li>Set <em>NT Domain</em> if it is a domain-based account and you feel like it (I tried with <em>User name</em> as plain username and no <em>NT Domain</em> set, with <em>User name</em> as domain\username and no <em>NT Domain</em> and with <em>User name</em> as plain username and <em>NT Domain</em> set and everything worked - a far cry from when I was first trying to connect years ago). </li></ul></li><li>PPTP Advanced Options (Advanced button from the Identity section) <ul><li>Uncheck all authentication methods <strong>except</strong> <em>MSCHAPv2</em></li><li>Check <em>Use Point-to-Point encryption (MPPE)</em></li><li>Leave <em>Security</em> set at <em>All Available (Default)</em></li><li>Check <em>Allow stateful inspection</em></li><li>Uncheck <em>Allow BSD data compression</em></li><li>Uncheck <em>Allow Deflate data compression</em></li><li>Uncheck <em>Use TCP header compression</em></li><li>Uncheck <em>Send PPP echo packets</em> (this setting works either way, check it for debugging purposes) </li><li>Leave <em>Use custom unit number</em> unchecked. </li></ul></li></ul><p>Normally at this point we would save and test the connection, but for Fedora there are additional steps.  We need to configure the firewall to allow connections on the GRE protocol.</p>
<p>Note that GRE is a protocol like TCP or UDP, not a particular port.</p>
<p>The Fedora firewall demon allows you to make changes in two modes: permanent changes which affect the configuration but not the running instance and temporary changes which affect the running instance but not the configuration.  To enable GRE traffic through your firewall, use the following command:</p>
<code>sudo firewall-cmd --add-protocol=gre sudo firewall-cmd --query-protocol=gre </code><p>Now test out your VPN connection.  If it is working, save the changes to the configuration of the firewall:</p>
<code>sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-protocol=gre sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --query-protocol=gre </code><p>Note that if you have multiple network connections (e.g. wireless vs wired), it may be necessary to configure the firewall for each one.</p>
<p>Once the VPN connection is working you may want to try to tweak it further as described below.</p>
<p>One problem with the VPN I connect to is that all traffic ends up using the VPN when I am connected.  This is less than ideal if you are connecting to servers on the internet while the VPN is connected since the traffic goes through the VPN server before coming to you.  The following describes the settings for routing only the proper traffic to the VPN.  (Read them all the way through first to make sure you have all the necessary information.)</p>
<p>Start by opening the <em>IPv4 Settings</em> section in the configuration of your VPN.</p>
<ul> <li>Set <em>Additional DNS servers</em> using the IP address of the DNS server for the VPN.  (You may need to ask your IT guy for this; there should be a way to discover it when connecting as above but it escapes me.)  </li> <li>In the <em>Routes</em> section, add a new route:   <ul>   <li>For <em>Address</em>, use the internal IP address of the VPN server applied against the netmask below, e.g. if the VPN server is 10.23.34.89 and the netmask is 255.255.255.0, use 10.23.34.0.  Again, this should be the <strong>internal</strong> IP address for getting to the machine in the intranet, not the external IP address for getting to the machine from the internet.    </li>   <li>For <em>Netmask</em>, use the netmask of your intranet.  (If you are confused, ask your IT guy what to use for both this and the <em>Address</em>.)  For most networks this will be 255.255.255.0, but for many it will be different.    </li>   <li>For <em>Gateway</em>, use 0.0.0.0.    </li>   <li>Do not set the <em>Metric</em> unless you know what you are doing.    </li>  </ul> </li> <li>If necessary, add additional routes.  E.g. you might have a DMZ in the 10.0.0.0/24 network in the VPN you are connecting to.  </li> <li>Check <em>Use this connection only for resources on its network</em> </li> <li>  In other versions of the NetworkManager configuration tool, there was a field for <em>Additional search domains</em>.  This field is missing on Fedora 24 and some experimenting and testing seems to indicate we don't need it.  </li></ul><p>OK, so now when you connect you should see regular traffic going directly to the internet and intranet traffic directed to the VPN server.  You can test this out with <tt>traceroute</tt> (which you may need to install).</p>
<p>Let me know how these instructions work for you and what type of systems you&#8217;ve been able to connect.</p>
