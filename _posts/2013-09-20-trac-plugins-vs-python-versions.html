Just a quick and dirty reminder than when you are trying to make Trac plugins work, you need to make sure you are using the correct python version of the egg. &nbsp;For example, I recently wanted to add the&nbsp;<a href="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/RegexLinkPlugin" target="_blank">RegexLinkPlugin</a>&nbsp;to one of my Trac instances. &nbsp;However, when I downloaded the provided egg and installed it, nothing happened. &nbsp;Upon further inspection, I realized that the egg was for Python 2.5 and I was running 2.6 on my server. &nbsp;I downloaded the source and recompiled and was rewarded with a (working) Python 2.6 egg.<br />
<br />
By the way, the&nbsp;<a href="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/RegexLinkPlugin" target="_blank">RegexLinkPlugin</a>&nbsp;is a nice way to map wiki text to links in your Trac installation. &nbsp;For example, I am using it on an IT wiki where each server has its own page but the servers are all referred to by all lowercase hostnames. &nbsp;Using&nbsp;<a href="http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/RegexLinkPlugin" target="_blank">RegexLinkPlugin</a>&nbsp;I can map each hostname to link to the page for the server with no extra wiki markup, ensuring my users always generate the links when using the hostnames.
