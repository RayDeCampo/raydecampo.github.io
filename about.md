Lab notes is a bare bones blog where Ray has collected bits of knowledge that I would like to refer to later.

Ray is a software architect, father, resident of the frozen tundra of Upstate New York, and a very lazy blogger. He enjoys hacking around on his computer (obviously), basketball and talking about himself in the third person. If you would like to know more, see the links below.
